Introduction
============

This is a tmTheme for [textmate](http://macromates.com/) which also works on [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2).

It is inspired on the Visual Studio theme [Son of Obsidian](http://studiostyl.es/schemes/son-of-obsidian) which is inspired in Eclipse [Obsidian](http://www.eclipsecolorthemes.org/?view=theme&id=21).

I am unsing it mainly for html and javascript, feel free to enhance and send me the changes.
